# Endoscopic Bladder Tissue Classification

This project presents a deep learning solution for the early detection of bladder tissue carcinoma using EfficientNet. By fine-tuning this powerful model architecture, the project achieves high accuracy in classifying bladder tissue images. The model is integrated into a Flask web application, providing a practical tool for healthcare professionals to perform real-time image classification, aiding in quick and reliable diagnostic decisions. The dataset used for this project is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/endoscopic-bladder-tissue-classification-dataset).
